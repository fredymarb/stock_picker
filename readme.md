# Stock Picker
The purpose of this project is to solidify my understanding of working with arrays

## Instructions
Implement a stock_picker that takes in an array of stock prices, one for each hypothetical day. It should return a pair of days representing the `best day to buy` and the `best day to sell`. Days start at 0.

```ruby
stock_picker([17, 3, 6, 9, 15, 8, 6, 1, 10])
> [1, 4] #for a profit of $15 - $3 == $12
```
